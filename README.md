Working code may not always be the best code. Things like semantic tabs can take a functional website and push it that much further. As designers we should strive to do better. The same is true of CSS we can individual style each named element and class but redundancy can make changing elements tricky. Why change 5 attributes when you can change one and have the same effect.

## Assignment

Using best practices, I have refractored the provided code (html and css) to make it more accessible and well orginized. Replacing div tags with more specific elements as well as adding alt tags and other quality of life changes.

## What I did

* Changed generic div tags to semantic tags such as header, footer, etc.
* added alt text to images within the html.
* added an ID tag to fix a broken link to command. 
* changed classes within the same element to match so they could all be styled the  same way using css instead of needing three different css elements to style.
* changed h2 in footer to h4 to follow a sequential order from top to bottom.
* in the css I reorginized the attributes so they would fall in the same order as the elements appear in the html.
* consolidated redudant elements into parent classes, as well as moved a few elements such as text color to the body attribute as it appears in most other elements.
